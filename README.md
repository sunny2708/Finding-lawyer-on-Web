# Wakaalat on web

Finding the best lawyer in one go is very difficult for every citizen of this country.
Some can't afford and some don't know where to start and whom to approach.
Uneven understanding of the professional domains of lawyers is another major problem.
People have to surf different websites for hours to know and contact the best suited lawyers.

Wakaalat on web is like a one-stop shop for finding lawyers. We provide information about lawyers, their specialties, and their success stories. This makes it easier for people to get the legal help they need and promotes fairness and harmony in society.


How It Works:

1. User Registration: First of all, a user can start by signing up or logging up with your email. 
2. Finding Lawyers: Once you're logged in, you can look for lawyers through our menu. Let's say you need a family lawyer. You'll find a list of family lawyers with ratings to help you choose.
3. Contacting Lawyers: You can contact the lawyers directly by clicking on their profiles. You can even have video calls with them in real time using the Agora framework.
4. Lawyer Registration: Lawyers can join our platform by filling out a registration form. This adds their profiles to our system.
5. Useful Content: We also have a section with helpful information, like government guidelines and blogs written by legal experts.
6. Fundraising: There's a section where you can raise funds with the help of sponsors and volunteers. This builds a sense of community.

This project is being created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. We also integrated the Agora framework for real-time video calls, making it easier for users to connect with lawyers.
Users can make informed decisions, lawyers can expand their reach, and the community can come together to support one another through fundraising."
